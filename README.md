Self-study, personal projects, and experimentation

This repository contains an assortment of any combination of disconnected coding projects of my own invention. Nothing here is designed with an audience in mind or for professional use - it is merely my own personal space to practice front-end web code. Relevant documentation will be provided for all singular project files.
