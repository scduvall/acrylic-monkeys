Web Design Code Samples

This sample webpage is not intended for commercial use. 
It is a collection of various web development knowledge I have amassed throughout my career and continuing coursework.

Direction:

Please save a copy of the Web Design directory onto your desktop and open the file 'index.html' in a browser.
I strongly recommend opening the file in Firefox, Safari, or Chrome, as I am currently still learning cross-browser compatability and have run into problems with Internet Explorer.
The web page looks as intended across all of these browsers except IE.

Description:

Currently, this project consists of a single document. 
There is a navigation menu but they all hold self-referential links. Future pagination and/or sub-pages with direct linking will likely be implemented in the future.
In its present state, this page represents an educational form you might find on a site like W3Schools: teaching a user about HTML, CSS, or JavaScript code.
I've created a page that simulates HTML Manipulation. The included HTML form takes user input and generates a custom message based on that input. 
The form input is not being sent to a server using AJAX or PHP any other server-side technology; it parses the data using JavaScript and then returns a custom message using DOM manipulation.

Relevance:

I am maintaining this web page to test and implement various practices of web development for my own development and as an IT career supplement.
Design and coding techniques used in this project currently include:
Navigation menus - CSS pseudo-classes (::before, ::after, :hover, :visited, etc) - relative/absolute positioning - float elements - custom banner/header graphics - svg graphics - HTML forms - JavaScript event listeners and OOP-style functions - DOM manipulation - element transitions and transformations - font sizing using em's - responsive web design

Tasks:
- Make two more variants on the banner/header and use JavaScript to cycle through them with a timeout function
- Create a landing page and include the Form Manipulation document as an article within the web domain
- Test sources of cross-browser issues with Internet Explorer and find alternative solutions
